Code Style
----------
Consistent indentation plays an important role in readability and maintainability of code.

✅ Correct indentation:
```KOTLIN
fun correctIndent() {
	doSomethingHere {
		val x = "some string var"
	}
}
```
❌ Wrong indentation:
```KOTLIN
fun inCorrectIndent() 
{
	doSomethingHere 
	{
		val x = "some string var"
	}
}
```
Please follow the correct indentation style before submitting a pull request.
